### **Arbitrum Stylus Hackathon Guidelines**

#### **1. General Overview**
- **Objective**: To encourage developers to leverage Arbitrum Stylus and build innovative decentralized applications (dApps) or smart contracts using WebAssembly (Wasm) alongside Ethereum’s EVM-compatible infrastructure.
- **Participants**: Open to developers from various backgrounds—solidity, Rust, C/C++, Go developers, blockchain enthusiasts, and Web3 innovators.


#### **3. Hackathon Rules**
- Projects must use Arbitrum Stylus for a significant portion of the codebase. This can include writing Wasm-based smart contracts or creating dApps that leverage both Wasm and EVM functionalities.
- Teams can range from 1 to 5 participants.
- All code must be open-sourced and shared via a public GitHub repository.
- Teams must submit a demo video (2-3 minutes) explaining their project and showcasing its functionality.
- Judges will evaluate based on **Innovation**, **Technical Implementation**, **User Experience**, and **Impact**.



### **Sample Project Areas for Participants**

#### 1. **DeFi Applications**
   - **Cross-language DeFi Protocol**: Build a decentralized finance application leveraging the power of Wasm for computation-heavy processes (e.g., risk assessment, lending protocols) while integrating with EVM-based DeFi protocols for transaction handling.
   - **Gas-Efficient AMM (Automated Market Maker)**: Utilize the efficiency of WebAssembly to optimize smart contracts for decentralized exchanges, reducing gas fees while handling complex operations.

#### 2. **NFT and Gaming**
   - **On-chain Game with Wasm-based Mechanics**: Develop an on-chain game where game logic (e.g., battle mechanics, scoring algorithms) is powered by Wasm-based smart contracts, providing faster and more complex interactions.
   - **NFT Marketplace with Hybrid Contracts**: Build an NFT marketplace where the core auction and marketplace logic is written in Wasm for performance and cost savings, while EVM is used for interacting with popular Ethereum-based NFT standards (ERC-721/1155).

#### 3. **DAO Tools**
   - **DAO Governance Framework**: Create a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) tool that uses Wasm for governance processes like voting or funding allocation, optimizing for efficiency and gas cost, while integrating with EVM for treasury management.
   - **Cross-Language Voting System**: A voting dApp where the backend decision-making logic (e.g., multi-sig wallets, quadratic voting) is handled by Wasm, ensuring secure, gas-optimized voting mechanisms.

#### 4. **Oracles and Data Services**
   - **Efficient Oracle Service**: Build a decentralized oracle solution where Wasm handles heavy computation or data validation, and EVM is used to finalize transaction logic.
   - **Cross-Language Data Aggregator**: A service that aggregates off-chain data (e.g., weather data, stock prices) using Wasm for efficient data processing and feeds it into Ethereum dApps using EVM smart contracts.

#### 5. **Identity and Privacy Solutions**
   - **Decentralized Identity Management**: Create an identity platform where identity proofs and verifications are processed using Wasm for efficient computation, while interactions with existing Ethereum-based identity protocols occur via EVM contracts.
   - **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Implement a privacy-preserving application leveraging Wasm for zero-knowledge proofs computation, which could provide significant gas savings compared to traditional ZK implementations on EVM.

#### 6. **Cross-chain Applications**
   - **Cross-chain Bridge Using Wasm**: Build a cross-chain bridge that uses Wasm for efficiently handling validations and consensus mechanisms between two or more blockchains, while utilizing EVM for asset transfers and finalization.
   - **Multi-chain dApp**: A dApp that interacts with multiple chains using Wasm-based logic for handling off-chain computations and cross-chain interactions efficiently.

#### 7. **Infrastructure and Tooling**
   - **Gas-Efficient Developer Tools**: Build tools or libraries that help developers optimize gas costs using Wasm in their smart contracts.
   - **Blockchain Analytics Dashboard**: Develop a real-time analytics dashboard that collects data from various smart contracts (including Wasm-based ones) on Arbitrum, presenting insights on usage, gas costs, or transactions in an easy-to-use interface.

### **5. Judging Criteria**
- **Innovation**: How creative and original is the project? Does it introduce a novel solution or solve a real-world problem?
- **Technical Complexity**: How well is Wasm integrated with EVM? Does the project take advantage of the unique features of Arbitrum Stylus?
- **Execution**: Is the project well-executed? Does the smart contract or dApp function as expected? Is the codebase clean and well-documented?
- **Impact**: What is the potential impact of this project in the blockchain space? Does it have real-world applications? How does it benefit the community or ecosystem?
- **User Experience**: How easy is it to use or interact with the project? Does the interface reflect good design principles?
